# Pack Pal
A web application that helps users maintain their packing list while planning a trip. 
Enjoy using Pack Pal for a stress-free and organized travel experience! üåç‚úàÔ∏è

## Key Features

- **Add and Manage Items**
  - Users can easily add items to their packing list by filling out a simple form that includes item quantity, description/name, and an "Add" button.
  - The packing list dynamically updates to display all the added items, including quantity, description, and an option to mark items as packed.

- **Sort and Organize**
  - Users have the flexibility to sort their packing list based on different criteria, including input order, item description, and packed status. This makes it easy to prioritize and organize their packing.

- **Mark Items as Packed**
  - Users can mark items as packed by simply clicking a checkbox next to each item. Packed items are visually indicated with a strikethrough for quick reference.

- **Clear List**
  - For convenience, there's a "Clear List" button that allows users to quickly remove all items from their packing list. A confirmation prompt ensures they don't accidentally delete their list.

- **Packing Progress**
  - The stats component provides users with a real-time update on their packing progress. It displays the total number of items, the number of items packed, and the percentage of items packed, giving users a clear overview of their readiness for the trip.

Happy planning and safe travels! üåûüå¥
